### About

I’m a software engineer who enjoys working across the stack and understanding how systems fit together.

I don’t lock myself into one language or framework. I care more about clear code, reasonable tradeoffs, and software that’s easy to change when requirements inevitably shift.

Most of my day-to-day work lives in private repositories, so I use GitHub mainly for personal projects, experiments, and notes.

### What I usually work with

- Backend and APIs  
- Frontend applications  
- Databases and data modeling  
- Tooling and automation  

I’m comfortable picking up new tools when the problem calls for it.

### Tech I often use

Java, JavaScript / TypeScript, Spring Boot, Angular, React, Node.js, SQL, Docker, Git

### Languages

English • Portuguese • Arabic
