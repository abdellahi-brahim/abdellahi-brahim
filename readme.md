### 🔭 The Generalist Perspective

I am a Software Engineer who thrives on the big picture. I don't just write code; I design solutions. I believe that frameworks are tools, and my strength lies in choosing and mastering the right tool for the specific challenge at hand—whether that's a high-concurrency backend or a fluid, responsive frontend.

* **Backend & Systems:** Designing robust logic and data flows using **Java (Spring Boot), Node.js, and Python**.
* **Frontend Engineering:** Crafting intuitive interfaces with **Angular, React, and TypeScript**.
* **Infrastructure & DevOps:** Ensuring reliability through **Docker, CI/CD pipelines, and Cloud environments**.
* **Global Communication:** Effectively collaborating across cultures in **English, Portuguese, and Arabic**.

### 🧠 Current Interests
My focus is currently on **Software Architecture** and the integration of **Generative AI (LLMs/RAG)** to build smarter, more efficient applications. I enjoy exploring how modern engineering can bridge the gap between complex business logic and user needs.

> **Note:** Much of my professional work happens on private **GitLab** instances. While my GitHub activity may seem quiet, I am actively building and shipping software every day.
